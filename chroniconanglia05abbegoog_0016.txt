Simon Patriek Dean of Peterborough, and
Henry Wharton attribute it to John Abbot
of Peterhorough, and in the margin of the
Cotton MS. is the title Chronicon Angliae per

this writing is os a comparatively modern date.
Patrick has endeavoured to shew that Johannes
de Kaleto, who died A.D. 1262, was the au-
thor of the Chronicle down to his own time.
Dodsworth has quoted it by the name os the
Peterborough Chronicle, without determining
who was its author. Under the year 1000 is
a reference to Martinus Polonus, who con-
tinued his history down to the year 1276, a
fact which would lead to a question whether
Johannes de Kaleto, who died fourteen years
previously, could have been the writer of the
first part os the Chronicle. These remarks
taken from Sparke, lead us evidently to the
conclusion that we know nothing at all about
the author os the Chronicle; still less im-
portance is to be attached to his conjecture
that Johannes de Dupinge, another Abbot of
Peterborough, purchased it and gave it to the
monastery; or that Robert de Boston, who
was perhaps a monk of Spalding, added the
