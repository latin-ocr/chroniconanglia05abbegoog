runca. xiii

script furnished to the editor by John Bn'dges,
and does not seem to have been asterwards
cossated with the Cotton original. This cir-
cumstance will account for the existence of
several errors, such as Londom'am sor Romam,
filiis for fratribus, and many others, which
have all now been carefully corrected.

In the orthography of proper names of per-
sons and places the Chronicle is singularly in-
consistent, and though I have reduced a large
number of them 10 some degree of uniformity,
particularly in the ease of the most familiar,
yet it has been found difficult to accomplish it
altogether, and I have been at fault in so many
instances to determine what person or place
the author alluded to, that it became necessary
to retain the orthography of the manuscript
for fear of worse oonsequenceS.
