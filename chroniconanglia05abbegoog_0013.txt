chronology, until a much larger number of our

The tediousness of consulting documents which
exist only in manuscript is so great as to
amount almost to a prohibition.

Among the manuscripts forming the Cotton
collection in the British Museurn is a book
written on vellum of a size between Svo. and
4to, [Claud A⁴V,] containing about two hun-
dred leaves, of which the first part, containing
about sorty leaves, was not written before the
year 1368 z for it contains a work entitled
Chronicon Angiiae, which beginning with the
year of our Lord 654, records events that hap-

The rest οξ the manuscript is of the early part
of the thirteenth century. The contents os
the whole voluxffiffie as follows:
